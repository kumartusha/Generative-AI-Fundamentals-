#### Setting Up Your ChatGPT with Custom PDF Data (Research Papers) using LangChain

Welcome to the detailed guide for setting up your own ChatGPT with custom PDF data using LangChain. This README will walk you through the process of creating a chatbot system that allows users to upload PDF files, convert them into text, and use the text to create embeddings for semantic search in a vector database. This system utilizes a large language model for chat completion and can be customized with different models and libraries.

### Features
- **PDF Upload**: Users can provide their PDF files, which are then converted into text for further processing.
- **Semantic Search**: The system creates embeddings for the text and uses them for efficient semantic search in a vector database.
- **Customization**: The chatbot system can be customized with different models and libraries to suit specific requirements.
- **Vector Store Generation**: Learn how to generate a vector store from text chunks using embeddings and FAISS for efficient retrieval.
- **Conversational Chain**: The system initializes a conversational chain for handling chat interactions.
- **Information Extraction**: The application is capable of extracting information from documents based on user queries.
- **Use Cases**: Understand the potential use cases for this application, including extracting information from large PDF documents and creating personalized chatbots based on specific data sets.

### Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.x
- LangChain framework
- OpenAI GPT-3 or other large language models
- FAISS library for efficient similarity search
  
Now you're all set to share your ChatGPT with custom PDF data using LangChain on GitHub! Happy coding!
