## **🚀 Quick Start**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/generative-ai.git
cd generative-ai
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed. Then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Launch the Streamlit App**
```bash
cd streamlit
streamlit run app.py
```
Access the app at `http://localhost:8501`.

### **4. Start the Flask Backend**
```bash
cd flask
python app.py
```
API endpoints are accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.
